This is the summary. 

# Statement of need
[comment]: # (Statement of need section that clearly illustrates the research purpose of the software and places it in the context of related work.)

`sorbetto` is a Python package for producing classification tiles with different flavors. 

`sorbetto` was designed to be used by machine learning researchers. 

Figures can be included like this:

# Mention 
[comment]: # (representative set of past or ongoing research projects using the software and recent scholarly publications enabled by it.)

While the package has not yet been used in any scientific publications, it relies on foundations provided in recent publications [Pierard2025Foundations; Pierard2024TheTile-arxiv]. Besides, results from numerous publications already showcasing various tile flavors [Halin2024AHitchhikers-arxiv; Pierard2025AMethodology] could be replicated very easily thanks to this sorbetto package. 

Ongoing research projects may involve additional features that may be included in future versions of the package.
