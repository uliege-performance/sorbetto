Demos
=====

In order to help understand the core concepts behind the Sorbetto library, we
provide a set of interactive notebooks that you can download `here <https://github.com/uliege-performance/sorbetto/tree/main/demos/>`__.

We strongly encourage you to run them locally and experiment with them.
