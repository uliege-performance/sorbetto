Demos
=====

In order to showcase the core concepts behind the Sorbetto library, we provide a
set of interactive notebooks that you can download `here
<https://github.com/uliege-performance/sorbetto/tree/main/demos/>`__.
To run these interactively, it is necessary to download the demos and
execute them locally.

If you are interested in learning the core concepts of Sorbetto, we recommend
checking out our :ref:`Getting started` guide first.
