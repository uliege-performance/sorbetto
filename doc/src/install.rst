============

Sorbetto can be installed on virtually any computer with Python 3. There
are two main ways to install it:


From PyPI
---------

The recommended way to install Sorbetto is by using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install sorbetto

We recommend installing Sorbetto in a vitrual environment to better manage its
dependencies.

If you want to get the latest updates before release, or contribute to the
package, you can install it by cloning the GitHub repo:

    git clone https://github.com/uliege-performance/sorbetto.git
    cd sorbetto
    pip install .
